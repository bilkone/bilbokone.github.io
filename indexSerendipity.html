                <h3>Sometimes things happen because they have to happen</h3><br>
        
                <p>Falling in love is one of the most exciting, rewarding and scariest things you could ever do. Once you're in love with someone, it's hard to remember how you lived without him or her. It can feel as if you didn’t really start “living” until the two of you met. </p>
            
                <p>If you tried to construct a list of things you wouldn't do for your girlfriend, it would be pretty empty. When you're in love with someone, you may find yourself considering what makes them happy. "Love is such a subjective, complex, cognitive, emotional, and physiological experience,</p>    
                    
                <p>There is no one right way or time to fall in love, but when you do, it can be really special. If you recognize one of the seven signs that you’re falling hard, don’t panic! As long as your relationship is built on a foundation of open and honest communication and mutual respect, you can continue to grow together.</p>
                
                <p>Human relationships are hard. Sometimes we just make them harder by overthinking our decisions. Sometimes things happen because they have to happen, make sure you’re listening. Make sure you don’t let that bus pass you.</p>
            
            	<p>Believe in serendipity, let it touch you, let go of your ideas and enjoy the ride.</p>
