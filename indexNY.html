<p style="margin-left:50px">When the gloomy cold weather months hit, they hit hard. Your first reaction? To beeline it to the Bahamas for a winter vacation. Immediately. Or any other place where you can sip on some skinny margs and show off that bikini bod you've worked so hard to maintain over the past few months.
But as great as these exotic getaways are, we'd like to propose an alternative to the go-to winter escape: Embrace the season's chilly temps. Donning a heavy, clunky coat and taking advantage of the arctic chill can lead to a slew of health and mood benefits. (Plus, they can be just as fun!)
Done right, this year's real winter vacation will have you wishing it was snowy year-round.</p>

                    <p>It's hard to believe you're only a short distance away from NYC when booking a stay at this Victorian pile that opened in 1869. Mohonk is a winter wonderland for kids and parents alike. The ice rink is legendary, and older kids will love the tubing and snowshoeing—all of which are included in the price of your stay. When the weather is too cold or the crew's had enough activity, head to the fireplace for a mug of cocoa.</p>                     
                   
               
                    <p>Less than a two-hour drive north of New York City, you’ll find yourself surrounded by rugged mountain ridges, forests, and the small-town charm of New Paltz, home to the very special Mohonk Mountain House (pictured). Rooms can be on the pricier side, but even a one-night stay (weekdays only) in this stunning lodge-style resort (visited by past guests including John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and Teddy Roosevelt) is worth it. Despite its long history, the rooms have been kept in impeccable condition and almost all have their own fireplace. Amenities include a 33,000-square-foot spa, fitness center, game room, library, and indoor swimming pool.</p>

                    <p>Bear Mountain State Park is a year-round source of family fun. Sure, it has great hiking in warmer months, but the attraction is just as beautiful when snow blankets the hills and trails.</p>
                        
                    <p> It's a great place to try out cross-country skiing, and there's ice skating at outdoor rinks. Not feeling athletic? No sweat. The neighboring Trailside Museums and Zoo make for a fun afternoon of learning. Best of all, you can feel as though you're in another world, then return home to NYC and spend the night in your bed—the park is only one hour away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
